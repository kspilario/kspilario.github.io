## Competitive Programming

I used to join *competitive programming contests* during my undergraduate years (2010-2012) and trained under a university-wide organization called *UP Programming Guild (UPPG)* at UP Diliman. The coverage of these contests include data structures, algorithms, problem solving paradigms (dynamic programming, binary search, etc.), graph theory and graph algorithms, discrete mathematics, computational geometry, string processing, among other topics. 

You can find my profiles on the following platforms where we train for contests:
- **Project Euler** ([Site](https://projecteuler.net/), Username: kspilario) - 200+ Problems Solved, Level 8
- **UVA Online Judge** ([uHunt Profile](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/58112)) - 1,000+ Problems Solved

More recently, I also joined Cody to improve my MATLAB skills:
- **MATLAB Cody** ([Profile](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/players/8722869)) - 2,800+ Problems Solved 

Our teams from UPPG regularly compete in national contests and the [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/) (Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest), *"the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the worldâ€™s universities"*. I am proud that my team has been awarded:

- *1st Place* (2012) at the Java Cup Inter-collegiate Programming Contest, sponsored by UP CURSOR, UP Diliman
- *1st Place* (2010) and *2nd Place* (2011) at the Inter-University Programming Contest (IUPC), Ateneo de Manila University
- *Honorable Mention Award* (2010) at the ACM-ICPC, Asia Regionals, held at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
- *3rd Place* (2010) at the ACM-ICPC Nationals, Ateneo de Naga University, Naga City

My experience in these programming contests became the biggest reason why I pursue computational research in chemical engineering today. As a way of giving back, I occasionally help in preparing for the National Olympiad in Informatics, Philippines ([NOI.PH](https://noi.ph/)) and other national programming contests.
