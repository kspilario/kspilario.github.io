## Competitive Programming

I used to join competitive programming contests during my undergraduate years (2010-2012) and trained under a university-wide organization called UP Programming Guild at UP Diliman. You can find my profiles on the following training platforms:
- **UVA Online Judge** ([uHunt Profile](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/58112))
- **Project Euler** (Username: kspilario)
- **MATLAB Cody** ([Profile](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/players/8722869))

Our teams regularly compete in the [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/) (Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contests). My positive experiences in these programming contests became the biggest reason why I pursue computational research in chemical engineering today.
