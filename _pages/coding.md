## Competitive Programming

I used to join *competitive programming contests* during my undergraduate years (2010-2012) and trained under a university-wide organization called *UP Programming Guild* at UP Diliman. The coverage of these contests include data structures, problem solving paradigms (dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, etc.), graph theory, discrete math, strings, computational geometry, among other topics. 

You can find my profiles on the following platforms where we train for contests:
- **Project Euler** (Username: kspilario)
- **UVA Online Judge** ([uHunt Profile](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/58112))
- **MATLAB Cody** ([Profile](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/players/8722869))

Our teams regularly compete in the [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/) (Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest), *"the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the worldâ€™s universities"*. My positive experiences in these programming contests became the biggest reason why I pursue computational research in chemical engineering today. As a way of giving back, I occasionally help in preparing for the National Olympiad in Informatics, Philippines ([NOI.PH](https://noi.ph/)) and other national programming contests.
