## Competitive Programming

I used to join *competitive programming contests* during my undergraduate years (2010-2012) and trained under a university-wide organization called *UP Programming Guild (UPPG)* at UP Diliman. The coverage of these contests include data structures, algorithms, problem solving paradigms (dynamic programming, binary search, etc.), graph theory and graph algorithms, discrete mathematics, computational geometry, string processing, among other topics.

You can find my profiles on the following platforms where we train for contests:
- **Project Euler** ([Site](https://projecteuler.net/), Username: kspilario) - 200+ Problems Solved, Level 8
- **UVA Online Judge** ([uHunt Profile](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/58112)) - 1,000+ Problems Solved

More recently, I also joined Cody to improve my MATLAB skills:
- **MATLAB Cody** ([Profile](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/players/8722869)) - 2,800+ Problems Solved 

Our teams from UPPG regularly compete in national contests and the [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/) (Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest), *"the premier global programming competition conducted by and for the worldâ€™s universities"*. My experience in these programming contests became the biggest reason why I pursue computational research in chemical engineering today. Now, I solve problems by thinking in terms of algorithms. I believe that if an idea is clear to me, I can always code it. And I love it when the same elegant solution solves many seemingly unrelated problems at once!  

As a way of giving back, I occasionally help in preparing for the National Olympiad in Informatics, Philippines ([NOI.PH](https://noi.ph/)) and other national programming contests.

## MATLAB Cody Problems for Chemical Engineers

I teach a beginner MATLAB course for chemical engineering students at UPD. I train my students in the same way that I train for programming contests: Solve many problems! If you want to have a go at my coding problems, you can find them hosted in MATLAB Cody:
- [**Chemical Engineering Problems I**](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/groups/2385) - Beginner ChemE problems
- [**Chemical Engineering Problems II**](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/groups/2508) - ChemE problems involving graph algorithms
