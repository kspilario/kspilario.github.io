History
======
**PSEL@UPD** was established in 2012 upon the return of Dr. Jose C. Munoz to UPD from his Ph.D. at Chung Yuan Christian University (Taiwan). He headed the research laboratory until his retirement, advising both undergraduate and graduate research students. The lab is currently headed by Dr. Karl Ezra Pilario after he returned to UPD from his Ph.D. at Cranfield University (United Kingdom) in 2020.

Mission
======
**PSEL@UPD** aims to provide algorithmic, data-driven, and sustainable engineering solutions to process industries and other fields such as energy, water, and the environment. We use computational tools by integrating **machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence** with **chemical engineering principles** to aid process systems engineering activities such as design and simulation, modeling, control and monitoring, optimization, and predictive maintenance. 

Vision
======
In the long term, **PSEL@UPD** aspires to be a leading research group that houses the best Filipino talent in computer-aided chemical engineering in the Philippines, while being a trusted partner of industry practitioners and researchers locally and globally.
