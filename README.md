# Mission

**PSEL** at the University of the Philippines, Diliman (PSEL@UPD) aims to provide algorithmic, data-driven, and sustainable engineering solutions to process industries and other fields such as energy, water, and the environment. We use computational tools by integrating **machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence** with **chemical engineering principles** to aid process systems engineering activities such as design and simulation, modeling, control and monitoring, optimization, and predictive maintenance. 

# Vision

In the long term, PSEL@UPD aspires to be a leading research group that houses the best talent in computer-aided chemical engineering in the Philippines, while being a trusted partner of industry practitioners and researchers locally and globally.
