# Mission

The Process Systems Engineering Laboratory at the University of the Philippines, Diliman (**PSEL@UPD**) aims to provide algorithmic, data-driven, and sustainable engineering solutions to process industries and other fields such as energy, water, and the environment. We use computational tools by integrating **machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence** with **chemical engineering principles** to aid process systems engineering activities such as design and simulation, modeling, control and monitoring, optimization, and predictive maintenance. 

# Vision

In the long term, **PSEL@UPD** aspires to be a leading research group that houses the best talent in computer-aided chemical engineering in the Philippines, while being a trusted partner of industry practitioners and researchers locally and globally.
