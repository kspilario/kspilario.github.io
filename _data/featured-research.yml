- title: "Kernel Methods vs. RNNs for Learning System Dynamics"
  description: "Recurrent neural nets (RNNs) are widely used to learn the dynamics of processes straight from data. When training data is limited, we show that kernel methods can beat RNNs if we pay attention to the kernel design. [Read more](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9102405)"
