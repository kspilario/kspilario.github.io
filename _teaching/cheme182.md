### COURSE DESCRIPTION
Introduction to process dynamics of simple chemical systems. Time-domain, Laplace-domain, and frequency-domain techniques. Design and simulation of PID controllers for SISO systems.

### COURSE CREDIT
3 units (2 hr/week lecture; 3 hr/week lab)

### COURSE OBJECTIVES
At the end of this course, the students should be able to:
* Apply the concepts of material and energy balances, unit operations, chemical reaction engineering and mathematical methods to:
	* derive and simulate dynamic models of chemical processes,
	* solve for and analyze the response of chemical processes to process input changes,
	* derive the overall model of a control system using different feedback controllers;
* Design and analyze the stability, performance, and robustness of feedback control systems;
* Use computational tools to design, simulate, and analyze the behavior and stability of processes and control systems; and,
* Familiarize with common instrumentation such as valves, controllers, and sensors found in the industry, as well as their principles of operation.
